# DOM Access Assignment

Explore the project files.  There is an HTML page that shows a list of menu items and images.

The goal of the assignment is to use JavaScript to modify the page so that the images are all initially hidden and disply only when you click on a menu item.

You'll use the DOM Access methods discussed in Chapter 4 of Learning JavaScript to do this.
